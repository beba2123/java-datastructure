Linked-list 



java DATA-STRUCTURE...

Arrays == one of the method that is used to store multiple values at one time.
in arrays you can change the values that we stored by using their index but we cannot expand or shrink arrays that is the biggest drowback but there are some ways to fix this issues the first one is using  like dynamic array so the dynamic used for expanding our arrays like how we want...

linked-list ==> it is one of a abstract data-type it is used to store data or list of a data in a linked way lets say we are going to an a array and we are going to show how linked list works.

int a[] = {3,4,6,8}   if we use the linked list way  first all the time we make the first element as a header 
 and we call all elements a NODE each node has two things the info and the next node adress. 
in linkedlist the advantage is we can expand but the disadv is they are very slowly intrems of speed than the arrays one.
