java DATA-STRUCTURE...

Arrays == one of the method that is used to store multiple values at one time.
in arrays you can change the values that we stored by using their index but we cannot expand or shrink arrays that is the biggest drowback but there are some ways to fix this issues the first one is using  like dynamic array so the dynamic used for expanding our arrays like how we want...

linked-list ==> it is one of a abstract data-type it is used to store data or list of a data in a linked way lets say we are going to an a array and we are going to show how linked list works.

int a[] = {3,4,6,8}   if we use the linked list way  first all the time we make the first element as a header 
 and we call all elements a NODE each node has two things the info and the next node adress. 
in linkedlist the advantage is we can expand but the disadv is they are very slowly intrems of speed than the arrays one.

Stack 
it is one of the abstract data  type. it has so many features like add(push), delete(pop), find(peek). it uses the lifo method which means last in first out .when the stack is full and if we try to store a data inside it , it create  an error it is called overflow and if there is no value inside the stack and if we try to delete(pop) it creates an error called underflow error. 
you can implement the stack using the dynamic array it means that when you will expand or shrink your number of stack based on what you want.
